Iris dataset: A classic dataset containing measurements of Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica flowers.
Features: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width.
Target variable: Species of the Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
I used MACHINE LEARNING techniques like  Classification task: Identifying the category (species) of a flower based on its features &
Supervised learning: The model learns from labeled data (flowers with known species).
Application of this program is :-Machine learning introduction: A beginner-friendly project demonstrating core concepts.
Supervised learning practice: A practical example of training a model for classification.
Data exploration and visualization: Understanding data analysis techniques.
